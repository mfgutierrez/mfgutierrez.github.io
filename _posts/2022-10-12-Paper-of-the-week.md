I will try to give my thoughts on a paper that I find interesting each week. Last month, it was published in Nature the paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05235-6">"Antibody targeting of E3 ubiquitin ligases for receptor degradation"</a>

Here, the authors test a bispecific antibody that binds both the extraceullar domain of an E3 Ubiquitin ligase and a receptor of interest, such as IGF1-R. That way, by harnessing the Ub-ligase activity they can tag IGF1-R for degradation. I see interesting applications for this in the case of cancer, for example, where you can tag for degradation stuff like EFGR or HER2 (they actually did that in the paper!). I'm looking forward to see this tested in disease models to further test the feasability of this approach. I'm wondering if coupling this technology with Herceptin, for example, would have the same cardiotoxic effects as Herceptin alone.
